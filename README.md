## :information_source: Bio
Hello, I'm Valdemar (aka Val)! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Brazilian fullstack software engineer currently working at Banco ItaÃº S/A, Latin America's largest private bank. I'm an extremely open-minded and fast learner professional, who strives to improve my know-how and deliver efficient and consistent solutions.
In here you can find a variety of projects I've been working on my own, such as Unity games, small APIs, front-end applications and more.

I started coding at very early age - at around 14 years old - as I wanted to learn how to create games. My first contact with programming happened in the mid 2000s, when I started to work with RPG Maker XP and Ruby. A few years later, I moved to GameMaker 7 (and eventually GameMaker Studio 1 and 2) to work with GML (Game Maker Language, the engine's built-in scripting language), where I created most of my games (which unfortunately, I lost access to all the source code) and a 2D game engine I called Hammer2D.
In 2019, I decided to move one step foward and started to study Unity on my own, and that's where I simply fell in love with the engine, even developing my own 2D game engine/framework called Omega (which is hosted in here as a private repository :stuck_out_tongue:) to use on my own projects.

As a professional developer, my work portfolio includes working with both back-end and front-end applications using different technologies such as Spring, Angular, Git, Java, C, C++, C# and more. I also had the opportunity to work with mainframe computers and COBOL.

I'm also ardent for creative and engaging ideas across game development, where I've worked independently as a programmer, artist and designer for more than 5 years.
